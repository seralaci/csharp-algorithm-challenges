/*
 * Problem description:
 *
 * Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
 * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
 *
 * Example:
 * Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
 * Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
 * return [0, 1].

     * Complexity Analysis:
     *
     * - Time complexity : O(n^2).
     *   For each element, we try to find its complement by looping through the rest of array which takes O(n) time. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n^2).
     *
     * - Space complexity : O(1).
